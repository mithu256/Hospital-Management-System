Problem Specifiction

 In manual system,it is difficult to schedule the free time and it will be take more time to analyse it.
If the patient want to channel a doctor,he has to go to the hospital early and book for an appointment.Sometimes the appointments may be finished on that day.
For the receptionist,it is hard to check the appointments and cancel if  they don’t want an appointment.When a patient want to channel a doctor,the receptionist has to send the patient history file on his appointment time.That is very difficult.
For the pharmacist,If a stock is reduced,it is very hard to find which item is reduced from the stock and it will take more time to analyse the stock and update.
In the case of a pharmacist,it is very difficult to maintain Medical history file for each patient.

 The system will be designed in a way that,future modifications can be added easily.
